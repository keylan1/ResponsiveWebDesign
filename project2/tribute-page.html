      <p id="tribute-info">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, commonly known as AOC, was born on October 13, 1989, in New York
        City. Raised in the Bronx, she developed an early interest in politics and activism. AOC attended Boston
        University, where she studied economics and international relations.
        <br>
        <br>
        Her political journey gained prominence in 2018 when, as a Democratic candidate, she won the primary election
        for
        New York's 14th congressional district, defeating a longtime incumbent. AOC's victory marked a significant
        moment
        in U.S. politics, as she became the youngest woman ever to serve in the United States Congress.
        <br>
        <br>
        Known for her progressive policies and advocacy for social and economic justice, AOC has been a vocal and
        influential figure within the Democratic Party. She has focused on issues such as climate change, healthcare,
        and
        income inequality, earning both support and criticism for her bold stances.
        <br>
        <br>
        Beyond her legislative work, AOC is active on social media, using platforms like Twitter to connect with her
        constituents and engage in national conversations. Her dynamic approach and commitment to challenging the status
        quo have made her a key figure in contemporary American politics.
